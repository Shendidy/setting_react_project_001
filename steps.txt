1- CLI: npm init

2- CLI: npm i webpack webpack-cli -D (NB, you might need to add the following 2 lines before being able to add . in git repository
  a- $ git config --global core.autocrlf false
  b- $ git config --global core.safecrlf false
)

3- Create the src folder

4- Create index.js in src folder

5- Fix package.json to replace script "test" with this:
      "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack --mode development",
        "build": "webpack --mode production"
      },

NOTE: if you type in the CLI now "npm run start" it will create the folder dist, and a file inside it main.js. you don't need to do so, but it's worth knowing it!

6- CLI: npm install react react-dom -S  (-S to save it for all project environments, not just the dev. NB, you can use 'i' instead of 'install'!)

7- CLI: npm i babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react -D
NB, babel is the dependency responsible for transpiling any ES6 to ES5 since not all browsers understand ES6 yet. "-D" is to tell our application that babel is only needed for the development side of our app, not for the production side.

8- Create file webpack.config.js in the root folder and fill it with:

      module.exports = {
        module: {
          rules: [
            {
              test: /\.js$/,
              exclude: /node_modules/,
              use: {
                loader: "babel_loader"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      };
